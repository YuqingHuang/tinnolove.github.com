From iOS5, By default, these accessor methods are synthesized automatically for you by the compiler, so you don’t need to do anything other than declare the property using @property in the class interface.

When you’ve written customized getter and setter for a property, you should write @synthesize for this property if you want to use the default ivar of this property.

Eg.

-ivar will work-
in .h:
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *suit;

in .m:
- (void)setSuit:(NSString *)suit
{
    if ([suit isEqualToString:@"heart"]) {
            _suit = suit; //fine
                }
                
                }


                -ivar will not work, build will fail- 
                in .h:
                @property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *suit;

                in .m:
                - (void)setSuit:(NSString *)suit
                {
                    if ([suit isEqualToString:@"heart"]) {
                            _suit = suit; //will display error here
                                }
                                
                                }
                                - (NSString *)suit
                                {
                                    return _suit; //will display error here
                                    
                                    }


                                    solution:
                                    in .m ->
                                    @synthesize suit = _suit;

                                    Note: The compiler will automatically synthesize an instance variable in all situations where it’s also synthesizing at least one accessor method. If you implement both a getter and a setter for a readwrite property, or a getter for a readonly property, the compiler will assume that you are taking control over the property implementation and won’t synthesize an instance variable automatically.
                                    If you still need an instance variable, you’ll need to request that one be synthesized:

                                    @synthesize property = _property;
